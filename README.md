   # Fitness Activity Classification with CNN

   This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify fitness activities such as jogging, yoga, and cycling through image recognition. The goal is to train a robust CNN model and integrate it into a dashboard for real-time predictions.

   ## Project Structure
   - **data/**: Contains raw and preprocessed datasets.
   - **notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and experiments.
   - **models/**: Trained models and checkpoints.
   - **src/**: Source code for training, preprocessing, and inference.
   - **dashboard/**: Dash app for image upload and predictions.
